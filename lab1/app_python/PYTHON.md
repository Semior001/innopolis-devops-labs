# disclaimer
since I'm not a Python developer, but a Go developer, I can't provide good 
enough list of practices, frameworks and other fancy stuff (well, actually, it
seems kinda impossible to provide any list that would be good enough)

# lab 1 content
I've not used any best practice. I've choosen flask for it's simplicity, didn't
use any linters or formatters (for Go I've used gofumpt and golangci-lint).
